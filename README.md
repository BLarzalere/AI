# AI Neural Network Models - LSTM, CNN, AutoEncoders, GAN & Reinforcement Learning
This is a repository containing some of the AI models I've created. So far, it contains the following:

- Anomaly Detection AutoEncoders
- LSTM Encoder / Decoder & Standalone Encoder 
- Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial Networks (DCGAN)
- Facial Recognition Convolutional Neural Network
- Image Classificaiton using Convolutional Neural Networks
- LSTM-based Text Generation Models
- Static and Dynamic Object Detection using YOLO
- Various Reinforcement Learning Programs
- Sentiment Analysis
- LSTM Sequence Prediction
